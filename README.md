## Sogeti Web App

## Motivation
This coding challenge was very exciting to work on as it truly aligns with what I want to do in software development. I did not complete everything I wanted to, but my two hours is up and I got as far as I could! I was able to create a database in SQL Server and connect to it using my web app, add data to the database, retrieve it, and list it on the webpage. I was also able to connect and write queries to pull the information from the database. 

I have used MVC before in a SmartHome thermostat I designed in school, you can view that here https://github.com/esegebart/SmartHomeThermostat_JavaFX.

(This was when I was first learning GIT so my files are all added manually and hard to navigate and I unfortunately broke the computer with that project on it 
so here are some code samples:

Main.java - https://github.com/esegebart/SmartHomeThermostat_JavaFX/blob/master/Main.java
HolidayController - https://github.com/esegebart/SmartHomeThermostat_JavaFX/blob/master/HolidayController.java
IncrementTempController - https://github.com/esegebart/SmartHomeThermostat_JavaFX/blob/master/IncrementTempController.java
ProgramScreen - https://github.com/esegebart/SmartHomeThermostat_JavaFX/blob/master/ProgramScreen.java

This was coded using Java 8 and JavaFx for the GUI.)

## Code style
I was trying to get the API stuff set up and retrieve some information, so desing is set up, not a ton of functionality. 

## What My Next Steps Would Be
I would focus on getting the endpoints working now that the app is set up and connected how I want it to be. I would then add more testing.
